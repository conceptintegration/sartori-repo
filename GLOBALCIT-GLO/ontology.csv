key,label,description
1,Achievement-based acquisition of citizenship,"Acquisition of citizenship after birth based on special achievements (in sports, science, the arts, etc.). Can be based on achievements in the past or expected achievements in the future."
2,Acquisition of citizenship,"Becoming a citizen, whether by birth or at any time after birth, whether by automatic attribution, by individual declaration, registration, option or application, or by non-automatic attribution by public authorities."
3,Acquisition of citizenship after birth,"Acquisition of citizenship that does not take place automatically and immediately at birth; or soon after birth by declaration, registration, making use of an option or similar action, on the basis of conditions for the acquisition that were met already at the time of birth."
4,Acquisition of citizenship at birth,"Acquisition of citizenship that either occurs automatically (ex lege) and immediately at birth; or can occur immediately after birth by declaration, registration, making use of an option or similar action because all the conditions for acquisition had already been met at the time of birth."
5,Acquisition of citizenship by adoption,Automatic acquisition of citizenship as a result of the adoption of the person concerned by a reference person who is a national of the country under consideration.
6,Acquisition of citizenship by application,Acquisition of citizenship that requires an application by the person or his or her legal representative that initiates a procedure during which the public authorities have to assess criteria for granting citizenship.
7,Acquisition of citizenship by conferment,"Used in some countries for certain modes of acquisition of citizenship characterised by: non-automatic acquisition; and requiring not only an expression of intent by the person or his or her legal representative, but also an act by the responsible public authority."
8,Acquisition of citizenship by declaration,"Acquisition of citizenship by declaration is generally characterised by: facilitated procedure and conditions; voluntary acquisition; and/or the need for an oral or written declaration (by the person or by his/her legal representative) addressed to the relevant public authorities. In some countries, declaration is regarded as a unilateral act by the person concerned with immediate effect."
9,Acquisition of citizenship by descent,"The determination of a person's citizenship on the basis of the citizenship of his or her parents (or one parent or one particular parent) or ancestor(s) in direct line at the time of the person's birth or at the time of acquisition of citizenship by the person (the two points in time are different in cases of acquisition after birth). Ancestry-based ius sanguinis may, e.g. provide for the extraterritorial acquisition of citizenship after birth if an emigrant grandparent had never renounced his or her citizenship of origin. GLOBALCIT uses the term ius sanguinis in a broad way that covers not only automatic acquisition at birth, but also non-automatic acquisition at birth and after birth. Ius sanguinis generally applies to legal parenthood (in cases where legal parenthood differs from biological parenthood). We distinguish between territorial ius sanguinis in the country and extraterritorial ius sanguinis for children born abroad."
10,Acquisition of citizenship by legitimation,Automatic acquisition of citizenship by a child born out of wedlock based on legitimation (i.e. legal recognition of paternity) by a father who is a citizen of the country under consideration.
11,Acquisition of citizenship by registration,Acquisition of citizenship that comes into effect through an act of registration with the public authorities by the person or his or her legal representative. It is characterised by: a facilitated procedure and (substantially) facilitated conditions; voluntary acquisition; and a unilateral act by the person making use of the option.
12,Acquisition of citizenship otherwise than by descent,Citizenship gained by naturalisation or ius soli.
13,Acquisition/retaining of citizenship by option,"Acquisition of citizenship by option is characterised by: a facilitated procedure and (substantially) facilitated conditions; voluntary acquisition; and, in some countries by a unilateral act of the person making use of the option, the need for the person or his or her legal representative to choose one of two (or more) alternative nationalities that the person could acquire at birth or wishes to retain after birth."
14,Active registration,Voter registration system in which eligible voters are not registered automatically but need to apply to be registered in the electoral roll.
15,Active voting rights,"Usually refers to 'active voting rights', i.e., the right to cast a vote in an election."
16,Annulment of citizenship,"A determination by a public authority that a past acquisition of citizenship is null and void because it is established ex post that conditions required for the acquisition were in fact not met at the time of application or declaration by the person in question or at the time of decision by the responsible authority (whichever is applicable). As a result of this decision, the person is retrospectively deemed never to have been a citizen. Nullification may be a response to fraud by the person concerned, but also to an error committed by the public authority. Nullification can have a retroactive effect (ex tunc) or effect from the time of the decision (ex nunc)."
17,Assimilated representation (of non-resident voters),A system of representation of non-resident voters that merges their votes with those cast in domestic electoral constituencies and does not represent the former through reserved seats.
18,Attribution of citizenship,"Acquisition of citizenship without involving the consent or an expression of will by the person concerned, including automatic acquisition at birth or after birth and non-automatic acquisition based on a decision by public authorities."
19,Automatic acquisition of citizenship,"Ex lege acquisition of citizenship, i.e. acquisition of citizenship by an act of law that does not require some form of expression of intent by the person concerned or his or her legal representative in order to acquire citizenship."
20,Automatic loss of citizenship,"Ex lege loss of citizenship, i.e. by an act of law that requires neither explicit expression of intent (application, declaration, making use of an option or similar modalities) by the person or his or her legal representative to renounce citizenship, nor a decision by a public authority."
21,Automatic registration,Voter registration system in which eligible voters are automatically registered in the electoral register without having to apply.

23,Candidacy rights,"The right to stand as a candidate (or simply, 'the right to stand') in an election."
24,Citizenship,"A legal status and relation between an individual and a state or other territorial polity (such as the European Union, a federal province, or only partially recognised states) that entails specific legal rights and duties. Citizenship of a state is generally used as a synonym for nationality (see: nationality). Where citizenship is used in a meaning that is different from nationality it refers to the legal rights and duties of individuals attached to nationality under domestic law. In some national laws, citizenship has a more specific meaning and refers to rights and duties that can only be exercised by nationals after the age of majority (such as voting rights) or to rights and duties that nationals can only exercise in the national territory."
25,Citizenship ceremony,"Meeting organised by public authorities where newly naturalised persons are individually or collectively welcomed as new citizens of a state, which may include a sworn oath or pledge of loyalty."
26,Citizenship interview,An administrative procedure in which an official conducts an oral interview with persons applying for citizenship.
27,Citizenship law,Law regulating the acquisition and loss of the legal status of citizenship.
28,Citizenship requirements,"Legal requirements pertaining to the acquisition and loss of citizenship. This refers to birthright acquisition requirements, naturalisation requirements and conditions for voluntary or involuntary loss of citizenship."

30,Compulsory voting,"A legal duty to cast a vote in elections, independently of whether there is a sanction for non-compliance with this duty."
31,Consular protection,"The right of a citizen to receive protection from the diplomatic or consular authorities of a state. Traditionally, consular protection is provided by the state of which the person is a citizen, but this may also be another state with which the person has a privileged relation (e.g. another EU Member State for citizens of the European Union in third countries)."
32,Consular services,"Services provided by a sending state (including consular protection) involving the exercise of official functions, also electronically (e-government), in accordance with international agreements and practice, and the laws of the receiving state, in particular: issuing travel documents, acting as notary and civil registrar and in capacities of a similar kind, performing certain functions of an administrative nature, transmitting judicial and extrajudicial documents, executing rogatory letters or commissions to take evidence for the courts of the sending state, establishing a polling station or providing assistance for voting in elections of the sending state."
33,Cultural affinity-based acquisition of citizenship,"Acquisition of citizenship after birth on the basis of a particular cultural background, e.g. for persons of a particular ethnicity, mother tongue or colloquial language and/or religious affiliation. We include in this category also acquisition of citizenship based on presumed racial affinity."
34,Denationalisation,"Any form of involuntary loss of citizenship whether automatic or non-automatic (including lapse, withdrawal, nullification) that is not initiated by the person or his or her legal representative. Revocation can be either automatic (ex lege) or initiated by the responsible public authorities."

In several (mostly European and South American) states, denizens enjoy additional rights, such as voting and candidacy rights in local elections."
37,Deprivation of citizenship,"Any form of involuntary loss of citizenship whether automatic or non-automatic (including lapse, withdrawal, nullification) that is not initiated by the person or his or her legal representative. Revocation can be either automatic (ex lege) or initiated by the responsible public authorities."
38,Diplomatic protection,Is exercised by a state against another state in order to protect the rights or interests of a citizen that have been injured by that other state.
39,Direct election,"Election of a president, provincial governor, or mayor by citizens of the respective territorial polity."
40,Discretionary naturalisation,"Acquisition of citizenship following a decision by public authorities that is not based on an individual entitlement of the person concerned. The person may, but need not, be granted citizenship if the conditions specified in the law have been met."
41,Domestic ius sanguinis,Ius sanguinis for persons born on the territory of the country under consideration. Some countries limit the principle of jus sanguinis by imposing additional conditions for extraterritorial ius sanguinis (such as domestic birth of the parent transmitting citizenship to the child born abroad) that do not apply to domestic ius sanguinis.
42,Dual citizenship,Legal status of citizenship held by a person simultaneously in two (dual citizenship) or more states. Multiple citizenship may be acquired at birth or after birth and with or without the knowledge and consent of all the states involved. The term 'multiple citizenship' refers only to the legal status of citizenship a person holds in several states and does not specify the person's rights and obligations vis-à-vis the state of second or third citizenship where the person does not currently reside. (Some states distinguish between citizenship that can only be held by residents of the state and nationality that may also be held by expatriates.)
43,Dual nationality,Legal status of citizenship held by a person simultaneously in two (dual citizenship) or more states. Multiple citizenship may be acquired at birth or after birth and with or without the knowledge and consent of all the states involved. The term 'multiple citizenship' refers only to the legal status of citizenship a person holds in several states and does not specify the person's rights and obligations vis-à-vis the state of second or third citizenship where the person does not currently reside. (Some states distinguish between citizenship that can only be held by residents of the state and nationality that may also be held by expatriates.)
44,Effective nationality/genuine link,A principle used primarily in private international law in cases of conflicting rights and duties of multiple citizens in order to determine the state whose law ought to prevail. In its 1955 Nottebohm judgment the International Court of Justice extended the principle to cover also cases of singular nationality and alleged abusive acquisition of another country's nationality in order to avoid duties towards a state of current residence or to benefit from diplomatic protection against that state.
45,Electoral rights,Include the right to cast a vote (active voting rights) and the right to stand as a candidate (candidacy rights).
46,Entitlement to acquire citizenship,"Acquisition of citizenship based on a decision by the public authorities that must be granted by them if and when the relevant conditions specified by the law have been met. Whether or not the acquisition is based on a legal entitlement depends primarily on the mode of the authorities' final decision, not on the actual contents or clarity of the conditions themselves. The conditions themselves may leave some room for discretion by the authorities (e.g. stable income, good character) but, if the authorities come to the conclusion that the conditions specified by law are met, they have to grant citizenship to the person."
47,European Union citizens,Individuals who are nationals of any of the Member States of the European Union (EU).
48,European Union citizenship,"The legal status and rights of EU citizens, as defined in Articles 18, 20 and 21 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Directive 2004/38/EC (commonly termed the Citizenship or Free Movement Directive). These include the rights to: non-discrimination on the basis of (EU) nationality, move and reside freely within the EU, vote for and stand as a candidate in European Parliament and municipal elections, consular protection (help from the embassy or consulate of any other EU country to EU citizens in distress in a country outside the EU where they have no embassy or consulate of their own country), petition the European Parliament and complain to the European ombudsman, contact and receive a response from any EU institution in one of the EU's official languages, access European Parliament, European Commission and Council documents under certain conditions."
50,Extension of acquisition of citizenship,Acquisition of citizenship after birth (with or without consent) that is conditional upon or results automatically from the simultaneous acquisition of citizenship by a reference person.
51,External citizens,"Citizens of the country under consideration who are abroad whether on a short-term or long-term basis, including those who have acquired their citizenship by extraterritorial ius sanguinis and have never resided in their country of citizenship."
52,External citizenship,A set of rights and duties that citizens enjoy in relation to their country of citizenship when being outside its territory. External citizenship includes the rights of temporary absentees (such as those to consular and diplomatic protection and return) as well as rights of non-resident citizens (such as non-residents' voting rights in national elections).
53,External voting rights,"The right to cast a vote while not being present in the country where the election is held by any means that do not require physical presence, including postal ballots, voting in embassies, consulates or special polling stations abroad, electronic voting and proxy voting."
54,Extraterritorial ius sanguinis,Ius sanguinis for persons born to citizen parents outside the territory of the country.
55,Extraterritorial naturalisation,"Acquisition of citizenship after birth where residence requirements are fully waived, independently of whether the naturalisation procedure requires at some point presence in the territory."
56,Extraterritorial quasi-citizenship,"A set of rights granted to non-resident non-citizens that approximates the rights of non- resident citizens. Extraterritorial quasi-citizenship always includes rights of entry to the territory and residence there and thus can be converted into domestic quasi-citizenship (denizenship) by taking up residence. Extraterritorial quasi-citizenship rarely includes rights to consular protection (it does so for EU citizens residing in third countries where their member state is not represented), and, as far as we know, never includes voting rights. The most common categories who are granted extraterritorial quasi-citizenship are former citizens and their descendants, nationals of a former colony, nationals of other member states in a regional union of states (such as the EU or the Nordic Union), nationals of specific other countries on grounds of reciprocity, or foreign nationals who are seen to share a cultural, ethnic, linguistic, or religious affinity with the population of the country concerned."
57,Facilitated naturalisation,Acquisition of citizenship after birth for which residence requirements and/or other conditions for residence-based naturalisation are reduced or waived.
58,Filial extension of acquisition of citizenship (extension of acquisition of citizenship to child),Acquisition of citizenship after birth (with or without consent) that is conditional upon or results automatically from the simultaneous acquisition of citizenship by the person's parent(s).

60,Foundling,A child of unknown parentage found abandoned on the territory of a state.
61,Franchise,"Usually refers to 'active voting rights', i.e., the right to cast a vote in an election."
62,High public office,"Any of the following posts: 1. Head of State (where this is not a monarch); 2. Head of Government (e.g. prime minister); 3. Minister in the executive branch of government; 4. High ranking civil servant in the executive branch of Government (e.g. head of a ministerial department); 5. High ranking judicial offices (e.g. judge, public prosecutor in a high court; and 6. High ranking officer in the national army (e.g. general/ marshal)."
63,In-country voting,"The exercise of voting rights from within the territory of the relevant state in which an election is being held, independently of whether the voter has residence in the country."
64,Indirect election,"Election of a president, provincial governor, or mayor by the members of an elected assembly (national or regional parliament, local council)."
65,Investor citizenship,Acquisition of citizenship after birth that depends on an investment or another form of financial contribution in the country under consideration by the person concerned.
66,Involuntary loss of citizenship,"Any form of involuntary loss of citizenship whether automatic or non-automatic (including lapse, withdrawal, nullification) that is not initiated by the person or his or her legal representative. Revocation can be either automatic (ex lege) or initiated by the responsible public authorities."
67,Ius sanguinis,"The determination of a person's citizenship on the basis of the citizenship of his or her parents (or one parent or one particular parent) or ancestor(s) in direct line at the time of the person's birth or at the time of acquisition of citizenship by the person (the two points in time are different in cases of acquisition after birth). Ancestry-based ius sanguinis may, e.g. provide for the extraterritorial acquisition of citizenship after birth if an emigrant grandparent had never renounced his or her citizenship of origin. GLOBALCIT uses the term ius sanguinis in a broad way that covers not only automatic acquisition at birth, but also non-automatic acquisition at birth and after birth. Ius sanguinis generally applies to legal parenthood (in cases where legal parenthood differs from biological parenthood). We distinguish between territorial ius sanguinis in the country and extraterritorial ius sanguinis for children born abroad."
68,Ius sanguinis after birth,Acquisition after birth which is dependent on the fact that one or both of the person's parents already held citizenship of the country under consideration at the time of the person's birth and/or still holds that citizenship at the time of acquisition by the person concerned.
69,Ius soli,The determination of a person's citizenship on the basis of birth in the relevant country where this rule applies. This concept is used in a broad way that covers not only automatic acquisition at birth but also non-automatic acquisition at birth and after birth if territorial birth is the main condition for citizenship acquisition.
70,Lapse of citizenship,"Ex lege loss of citizenship, i.e. by an act of law that requires neither explicit expression of intent (application, declaration, making use of an option or similar modalities) by the person or his or her legal representative to renounce citizenship, nor a decision by a public authority."
71,Legal representative,"A person legally empowered to act on behalf of the person acquiring or losing citizenship, e.g. the parent of a minor child."
72,Loss of citizenship,"Loss of the status as citizen of a country (voluntarily or involuntarily, automatically or by an act of the public authorities). The main types of loss are renunciation by the person concerned and revocation of citizenship by the law or by a decision of public authorities. Revocation includes withdrawal and lapse (i.e. automatic loss ex lege)."
73,Mandatory voting,"A legal duty to cast a vote in elections, independently of whether there is a sanction for non-compliance with this duty."
74,Mode of acquisition or loss of citizenship,A manner of acquiring or losing citizenship based on a broad and distinct legal rule.
75,Multiple citizenship,Legal status of citizenship held by a person simultaneously in two (dual citizenship) or more states. Multiple citizenship may be acquired at birth or after birth and with or without the knowledge and consent of all the states involved. The term 'multiple citizenship' refers only to the legal status of citizenship a person holds in several states and does not specify the person's rights and obligations vis-à-vis the state of second or third citizenship where the person does not currently reside. (Some states distinguish between citizenship that can only be held by residents of the state and nationality that may also be held by expatriates.)
76,Nationality,Legal relationship between a person and a state (country) as recognised in international law. The terms nationality and citizenship refer generally to the same status and are thus frequently used as synonyms. GLOBALCIT prefers to use the term nationality when referring to international relations between states and to the relation of states to the citizens of other states.
77,Nationality law,Law regulating the acquisition and loss of the legal status of citizenship.
78,Nationality-of-origin-based acquisition of citizenship,Acquisition of citizenship that is specific to persons who are citizens of a particular other country or group of countries. Examples are facilitated naturalisation of EU citizens in some EU Member states and of Nordic citizens in all Nordic states.
79,Naturalisation,"GLOBALCIT categorises as naturalisation all modes of acquisition after birth other than those for which birth in the territory or to citizen parents is a condition. In a narrower sense, naturalisation is sometimes used to indicate the specific procedure through which citizenship can be acquired, which requires an application by this person or his or her legal representative as well as an act of granting citizenship by a public authority. In this second sense, a naturalisation procedure differs from declaration or option procedures that may provide a facilitated and/or less discretionary acquisition."
80,Naturalisation rate,"Naturalisation rates aim to measure the demographic transition rates between the categories of non-citizen residents and resident citizens. They are generally calculated as the ratio between the number of persons who acquired the citizenship of a country during a calendar year by naturalisation and the stock of foreign residents in the same country at the beginning of the year. When so defined, the denominator of the naturalisation rate includes persons who are not eligible for naturalisation because they do not meet residence and other requirements. Cumulative naturalisation rates measure the cumulative rate of non-citizen residents who naturalise after having resided in the country for a particular number of years."
81,Naturalisation requirements,Legal conditions or requirements for the acquisition of citizenship by naturalisation.
82,Non-automatic acquisition of citizenship,"Acquisition of citizenship that requires an act by a public authority and/or some form of expression of intent (application, declaration, registration, or making use of an option) by the person or his or her legal representative."
83,Non-automatic loss of citizenship,"Loss of citizenship that requires either that a public authority initiates a procedure to withdraw citizenship (rather than just issuing an official notice that citizenship has been lost ex lege) or some form of explicit expression of intent to renounce citizenship (application, declaration, registration, or making use of an option) by the person or his or her legal representative."
84,Non-citizen residents,Persons with residence in the territory of a state of which they are not a citizen. Non-citizens without a valid residence permit may be included if their de facto residence is otherwise registered or recognised by public authorities.
85,Non-citizens' voting/candidacy rights,"The rights of non-citizens to vote or stand as candidates in elections. As far as we know, such rights are never granted to non-resident non-citizens. Non-citizens' electoral rights may depend only on residence (in local elections in many European and South American countries) or also on the foreign nationality of the person. Nationality-of-origin-based electoral rights for non-citizens may be granted on a basis of reciprocity, of special historical relations between the countries involved, or shared membership in a regional union (such as the European Union where EU citizens enjoy local voting rights when residing in other Member States)."
86,Non-national EU citizen,A citizen of a Member State of the EU in relation to another Member State; also called second country national (SCN). Mostly referring to EU citizens residing in another Member State and who are sometimes also called 'mobile EU citizens'.
87,Non-resident citizens,"Citizens without residence in their country of citizenship, independently of whether they are present in the country at a relevant point in time (such as an election) or abroad."
88,Non-residents' voting/candidacy rights,The right of persons without residence in the country where the election is held to cast a vote or to stand as a candidate. In all empirical cases that we aware of these rights can only be exercised by citizens of the country.
89,Nullification of acquisition of citizenship,"A determination by a public authority that a past acquisition of citizenship is null and void because it is established ex post that conditions required for the acquisition were in fact not met at the time of application or declaration by the person in question or at the time of decision by the responsible authority (whichever is applicable). As a result of this decision, the person is retrospectively deemed never to have been a citizen. Nullification may be a response to fraud by the person concerned, but also to an error committed by the public authority. Nullification can have a retroactive effect (ex tunc) or effect from the time of the decision (ex nunc)."
90,Out-of-country voting,"The right to cast a vote while not being present in the country where the election is held by any means that do not require physical presence, including postal ballots, voting in embassies, consulates or special polling stations abroad, electronic voting and proxy voting."
91,Partial citizenship in special territories,Special citizenship statuses defined in a country's citizenship law for specific groups of persons applied in offshore or other designated territories (e.g. British Overseas or Dependent Territories) and that entail a lack or restriction of core citizenship rights and duties (such as the right to enter the country).
92,Partner extension of acquisition of citizenship (extension to unmarried partner),Acquisition of citizenship after birth (with or without consent) that is conditional upon or results automatically from the simultaneous acquisition of citizenship by the person's unmarried partner.
93,Partner transfer of citizenship (transfer to unmarried partner),Acquisition of citizenship after birth based on the fact that the person is the unmarried partner of a reference person who is already a citizen.
94,Passive voting rights,"The right to stand as a candidate (or simply, 'the right to stand') in an election."
95,Procedure for acquisition or loss of citizenship,"A set of rules regulating the competences and interaction of individuals and public authorities in the acquisition or loss of citizenship, independently of substantive requirements. A main distinction with regard to procedures is whether the acquisition or loss is automatic, i.e. becomes effective by act of law, or non-automatic, i.e. requires an act by a public authority and/or an expression of will (application, declaration, etc.) by the person or his or her legal representative. Procedures cover also the internal division of competences and tasks between different branches of public authorities (central and decentralised public administrations, courts, legislatures, etc.)"
96,Public service-based acquisition of citizenship,"Acquisition of citizenship after birth based on public service for the country, whether military or civil service (e.g. as civil servant, teacher or university professor, or voluntary activities regarded as public service)."
97,Quasi-citizenship,"A legal status and/or set of rights for specific groups of non-citizens that entails special privileges compared to other foreign nationals and that approximates the rights of citizens. We distinguish between domestic quasi-citizenship for non-citizen residents (denizenship) and extraterritorial quasi-citizenship for non-citizen non-residents. This distinction is not a sharp one since extraterritorial quasi-citizens mostly enjoy immigration and settlement rights and thus become domestic quasi citizens immediately after entering the country. By contrast, domestic quasi-citizens generally lose rights to return after long-term residence abroad."
98,Reacquisition of citizenship,"Acquisition of citizenship by a person who was previously a citizen. In most cases, naturalisation requirements are relaxed or dropped. Often, the procedure is based on declaration, registration or making use of an option."
99,Reference person,"Another person to whom the person acquiring or losing citizenship holds a special relationship that serves as grounds for special rules concerning the acquisition or loss of citizenship. Reference persons are mostly close relatives, such as parents, spouses or grandparents."
100,Refugee,"Person who has been recognised as a refugee and to whom the status of refugee has been conferred by the country under consideration according to the country's asylum law and/or the Geneva Refugee Convention. In a broader sense, refugee may refer to any person who has fled another country, who is now resident in the country under consideration and who has not yet acquired its citizenship. This category includes recognised refugees, persons with the status of de facto-refugees protected by non-refoulement (subsidiary protection), persons enjoying temporary protection and asylum-seekers."
101,Release from citizenship,"Loss of citizenship initiated by an application made by the person or his or her legal representative, but requiring the approval of a public authority. Release from citizenship is a special procedure applying to renunciation of citizenship."
102,Remote voting,"All methods of casting a vote outside the polling station in the electoral constituency where the voter is registered. Remote voting can be exercised inside or outside the territorial polity where the election is held. Remote voting methods include: option to vote in another polling station in the territory, voting by postal ballot inside or outside the territory, proxy voting, e-voting, voting at embassies, consulates or special polling stations abroad."
103,Renunciation of citizenship,Loss of citizenship initiated by a declaration or application by the person or his or her legal representative addressed to the relevant authorities expressing his or her intention or desire to give up the citizenship in question. The renunciation procedure can be either non-discretionary if it has to be granted or becomes effective automatically once all the legal conditions are met (renunciation by declaration); or subject to the approval of a public authority (renunciation by application or release from citizenship).
104,Residence requirements,"Conditions (e.g., for the acquisition of citizenship or exercise of electoral rights) that an individual must have resided on the territory of a state under consideration for a certain period of time or during a relevant period of time or must hold a certain type of residence permit."
105,Residence-based naturalisation,Acquisition of citizenship after birth for which the main condition is a certain period of residence on the territory of the country under consideration.
106,Residence-based voting/candidacy rights,"Electoral rights that depend on residence in the country where the election is held but do not depend on possessing a certain citizenship (of the country where the election is held or of a country whose citizens are granted special electoral rights, often on a basis of reciprocity, or of member states in a regional union)."
107,Resident citizens,"Citizens with residence in their country of citizenship, independently of whether they are present in the territory at a relevant point in time (such as an election) and of whether they are registered as local residents at a particular address. GLOBALCIT generally refers to residence as a legal fact, often documented in civic registries.... Individuals can simultaneously maintain several residences in different countries."
108,Resident voters/candidates,Individuals who exercise voting or candidacy rights while holding residence within the territory of the state in which an election is held.
109,Restricted citizenship (based on mode of acquisition or duration of possession),Status of persons who enjoy the same general legal status as other citizens but whose rights and/or duties are restricted because they have acquired citizenship via a certain mode (e.g. by naturalisation instead of by birthright); or they have so far held this citizenship for only a certain period. Restricted citizenship can apply both to residents (e.g. when naturalised citizens are excluded from high public offices) and to non-residents (e.g. when naturalised citizens who have left the country cannot transmit their citizenship by descent to their children born abroad).
110,Retrospective acquisition of citizenship,"Acquisition of citizenship retrospectively so that the person is treated as if he or she had been a citizen since a particular point in the past (in many cases, since birth) before the determination or granting of citizenship by the authorities."
111,Revocation of citizenship,"Any form of involuntary loss of citizenship whether automatic or non-automatic (including lapse, withdrawal, nullification) that is not initiated by the person or his or her legal representative. Revocation can be either automatic (ex lege) or initiated by the responsible public authorities."
112,Second country national,A citizen of a Member State of the EU in relation to another Member State; also called second country national (SCN). Mostly referring to EU citizens residing in another Member State and who are sometimes also called 'mobile EU citizens'.
113,Socialisation-based acquisition of citizenship,"Acquisition of citizenship after birth based on socialisation of a person before the age of majority in the country, i.e. acquisition by a person who has resided in the country for a certain period before the age of majority, or who attended school for some time and/or completed school there."
114,Special representation (of non-resident voters),A system of representation that creates special extraterritorial constituencies for non-resident voters and/or reserves special seats for their representatives.
115,Spousal extension of acquisition of citizenship (extension to spouse),Acquisition of citizenship after birth (with or without consent) that is conditional upon or results from the simultaneous acquisition of citizenship by the person's (married) spouse.
116,Spousal transfer of citizenship (transfer to spouse),"Acquisition of citizenship after birth based on the fact that the person is the (married) spouse of a reference person who is already a citizen of the country under consideration. This includes not just automatic transfers of citizenship by marriage, but also non-automatic acquisition by naturalisation with special (mostly facilitated) conditions for spouses."
117,Statelessness,"The status of a person who is not considered as a national by any state under the operation of its law (Art 1(1) Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, 1954). A distinction between de facto and de iure statelessness is discouraged by UNHCR, which notes that determining whether a person is stateless is a 'mixed question of fact and law' (Handbook on the Protection of Stateless Persons, paras 7 and 23). The historical understanding of de facto statelessness was that this term applies to persons outside the country of their nationality who are unable or, for valid reasons, are unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country (see UNHCR 2010 Prato Conclusions).... At the point where they have exhausted all avenues to obtain official recognition or grant of nationality, they must be considered stateless persons without qualification - whether or not they appear to have entitlement to nationality under the law."
118,Third country national,Citizen of a state that is not involved in a relevant relation with the state concerned. Most commonly used for nationals of countries that are not Member States of the European Union.
119,Transfer of citizenship,"Acquisition of citizenship after birth (with or without consent) that depends on the previous possession rather than simultaneous acquisition of citizenship by a reference person.... Related terms: filial transfer of citizenship, spousal transfer of citizenship."
120,Undetermined citizenship,The status of persons who are unable to establish their citizenship or who are of unknown citizenship.
121,Voluntary acquisition of citizenship,"Any acquisition of citizenship which is not automatic (ex lege), and requires some expression of intent to acquire citizenship (application, declaration, registration, making use of an option) by the person or his or her legal representative. Voluntary acquisition may occur not only through naturalisation but also at birth, if it depends on a specific action by a legal representative of the person (such as registration of the citizenship of a child born abroad by the parents)."
122,Voting rights,"Usually refers to 'active voting rights', i.e., the right to cast a vote in an election."
123,Withdrawal of citizenship,The non-automatic loss of citizenship based on a decision by a public authority to deprive the person of his or her citizenship. The mere issuing of an official notice informing the person of the fact that he or she has lost citizenship ex lege does not count as a decision by the public authority.
